Java-Bean-Website-2014
======================

My Java 6 website that uses Java Server Pages (JSP), HTML5 to display the website information, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) for the layout of my website pages, a Java 6 Bean to move the user's contact details data from the Contact page to the Confirmation page and stores it into an Oracle SQL database (RDBMS) using NetBeans IDE and a Glass Fish server.
